<p> Nutrient-rich cooking: </p>
</div>

How you prepare and cook your food can be as important as the food you select to eat. Even the most nutritious foods will not provide its potential of nourishment if improperly cooked. It has been found that foods cooked the traditional way could lose from 50-80% of their nutrients because they were overcooked. This is the reason I created a new way of cooking to preserve nutrients, which I call Nutrient-Rich Cooking an optimal way of cooking using minimal cooking time and avoiding as much nutrient loss as possible while bringing out the foods' vibrant color, flavor, and aromas. The secret to Nutrient-Rich Cooking is precision using low cooking temperatures, exact cooking times, and specific cooking methods, which accommodate the unique characteristics of each food. Nutrient-Rich Cooking not only helps preserve nutrients but brings out the great flavor of food. Because cooking impacts the nutrients in your food, with Nutrient-Rich Cooking, I share with you how to cook your food just long enough to soften its fiber and change it as little as possible from its natural state. Nutrient-Rich Cooking helps to aid digestion and increase your enjoyment of health-promoting foods.
